Nginx Web Server Deployment with Ansible

Description
This Ansible playbook installs and configures an NGINX web server on the provided Candidate Test VM (3.248.170.28). It supports both HTTP and HTTPS using a self-signed certificate, and serves a basic HTML page showing the server's hostname.

The playbook is structured using Ansible roles, a template for the index.html, and a group-based inventory.

Prerequisites
Ensure the following are set up before running the playbook:

SSH access to the target VM (you have the public IP + SSH private key)

Ansible installed locally (ansible --version to verify)

VM is accessible on ports 22 (SSH), 80 (HTTP), and 443 (HTTPS)
